Scuffle Hill Brewing Company is formed by three guys who all have a passion for craft beer and brewing it. Our name is derived from Henry County history. Revolutionary War General Joseph Martin once stated he called his first plot of land “Scuffle Hill” because he had to “scuffle” to get the money to acquire the land. That is exactly what we are doing now. Our goal is to create a brick and mortar brewery in Henry County. We would be the first to open in Collinsville Virginia. We are wanting to help revitalize the city and bring a place for people to come hang out, socialize, and enjoy a great craft beer. For now, as we work on making that happen, we are wanting people of the local community to come try our homebrews and tell us what you think. Scuffle Hill Brewing Company is veteran owned and operated.

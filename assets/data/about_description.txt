Scuffle Hill Brewing Company is formed by three guys who all have a passion for craft beer and brewing. Our name is derived from Henry County history. Revolutionary War General Joseph Martin once stated he called his first plot of land “Scuffle Hill” because he had to “scuffle” to get the money to acquire the land. That is exactly what we did to open the brewery.

We are the first brewery to open in Collinsville, Virginia. We are wanting to help revitalize the area and bring a place for people to come hang out, socialize, and enjoy a great craft beer. Scuffle Hill Brewing Company is veteran owned and operated.
